We are a dynamic research group at the Smidt Heart Institute with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Our goal is to uncover underlying mechanisms that 
cause heart failure in cancer using interdisciplinary and computational approaches. We use systems biology approaches to measure metabolic alterations.
The Karlstaedt Lab has established several techniques including mathematical simulations, stable isotope tracer analysis, and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics
