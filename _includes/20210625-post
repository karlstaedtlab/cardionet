We are a dynamic research group at the Smidt Heart Institute with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Our aim is to explore and understand quantum materials, 
including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter.

<!-- ADD picture slides -->

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see Research).

We are located at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the heart of Los Angeles. 

We are looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and recent graduates to join the team!

We are grateful for funding from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the NIH/NHLBI for funding our lab.
