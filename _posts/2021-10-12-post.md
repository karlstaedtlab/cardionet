## JACC: Basic To Translational Science
We are excited to share our most recent collaboration with Bonnie Ky, Matthew Barrets and Ray Hu at the University of Pennsylvania, and Seth T. Gammon at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Our review highlights our current knowledge on how cancer cells can promote metabolic remodeling in the heart. We describe why these metabolic alterations provide opportunities for therapy and 
which targets are currently known. Further, we outline strategies to study cardiac metabolism using new imaging techniques and probes.
